# About Retro

Retro is a Microsoft MakeCode editor/simulator for a small subset of the 
ARM Thumb instruction set. You can code small assembly language programs
using the Blockly editor and run them in a simulator providing eight
32-bit registers (R0 through R7) and 64 32-bit words of memory. 

Legal memory addresses are multiples of 4, with minimal value 0 and maximal
value 252. Retro allows you to view values in decimal or hexadecimal
and to the change the state of registers and memory when the simulator
is not running. 

# on start block

The simulator only executes the instructions nestd inside the "on start"
block, which can be found in the "Control" category.

# Arithemetic

# Shift instructions

# Memory load and store

# Control flow
